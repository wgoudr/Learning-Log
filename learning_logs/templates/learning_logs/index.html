      <p class="lead">The Learning Log is there to help you keep track and take
        notes on any subject you're curious about. Begin by creating a new
        topic in the topics button in the navigation bar. Then create a topic on a subject 
        you find interesting. Once the topic is
        created, you can now add new entries for the topic you've just made. You can
        come back to the topic at any time to add more entries, or you can make
        new entries about different subjects. </p>
